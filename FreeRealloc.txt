C free() method
“free” method in C is used to dynamically de-allocate the memory. 
The memory allocated using functions malloc() and calloc() is not de-allocated on their own. Hence the free() method is used, 
whenever the dynamic memory allocation takes place. It helps to reduce wastage of memory by freeing it.

Syntax of free() in C
free(ptr);


C realloc() method
“realloc” or “re-allocation” method in C is used to dynamically change the memory allocation of a previously allocated memory. In other words, 
if the memory previously allocated with the help of malloc or calloc is insufficient, realloc can be used to dynamically re-allocate memory. 
re-allocation of memory maintains the already present value and new blocks will be initialized with the default garbage value.

Syntax of realloc() in C
ptr = realloc(ptr, newSize);
where ptr is reallocated with new size 'newSize'.
